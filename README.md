# .dotfiles
My unix/linux configuration files.

Contains configuration for all of the following:

+ bash
+ vim
+ tmux
+ zsh

I really don't recommend you use this yourself as this is my configuration and I
change it very frequently. Instead I recommend going to [this project][1] which
attempts to be a cut down version of my project for forking.
